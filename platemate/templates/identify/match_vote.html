In each photo you see below, a box containing one food will be highlighted.  Next to each photo you will see lists of foods generated by other Turkers.  <b>Pick the list which most accurately matches the contents of the highlighted portion of the photo.</b>  The best list should have all foods in the box included, and no ingredients that are not present.  <b>Avoid lists with duplicates</b>, such as including both "Meat &amp; Cheese Pizza" and "Pepperoni".<br /><br />

<b>If multiple lists are accurate, pick the simplest one.</b> This means the simplest list that still includes all major ingredients.  For example, "Pizza" is a better list than "Dough, Cheese, Tomato Sauce".
If a photo does not contain food, please skip this HIT.

          <b>Step 2: Look at the options below.</b> Other Turkers selected these foods to match the box. They were told to pick their best guess, <b>not to list all possibilities</b>. If any lists describe the same thing twice, they are wrong.

          <b>Step 3: Pick the best option above.</b>
          Choose the most accurate option. If many choices are accurate , pick the one that you would find easiest to measure the amount. This will usually be the shortest or simplest one, as long as it is still correct. <b>Never select a choice with duplicates, or multiple descriptions of the same food, like "brown rice, white rice"</b><br />
