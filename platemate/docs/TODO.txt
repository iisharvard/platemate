Model changes
- link up input, job, response, output
- add timing to all of them
- use it to prevent workers voting on stuff they did!
- on response, store the raw data they entered

describe only needs 2 iters, or shittier workers
tag /voteshouldn't prevent overlap

match improvements
- emphasize that they should NOT select everything that matches. instead, pick the best
- part vs. whole is still hard, like "Garnish" for "lettuce and onion"
- stop using word "ingredients"! Distinguish between parts and ingredients, like "butter", "salt", etc.
- maybe use language like, "imagine someone had to draw a picture from your description" or something
- limit # of ingredients. 4?
- take duplication down to 2
- Emphasize picking most general, or specific, or something

match vote needs more guidance
- branding
- generality vs. specificity
- avoiding duplicates within one list
- automatically decide if identical lists

measure improvements
- leaving out stuff in other boxes
- Emphasize measuring by volume or pieces, not weight, discourage "serving"
   + javascript warning if they choose a weight measurement. "judging weight by eye is difficult, unless you're using the portion guide"
   + javascript message if they choose volume "use the portion guide!"
   + js message if they choose serving "since people disagree about servings, only use this option as a last resort"
   + js message if they choose a tiny or huge number "this is a very small (big) number. are you sure there isn't a better unit to measure in?"
   + if they have tiny calories "this is almost no calories / huge number of calories. are you sure about your answer?"
- Measuring guide
- Show the total calorie calculation. Ask, does that look reasonable?
- Get variable number of answers, depending on agreement
- Detect outliers somehow!
- Background too dark to judge scale?

questions / general todo
- have people ignore foods that have no impact?
- run an experiment merge identify/describe desc and ingr
- extra step for marking reasonable/unreasonable measurements?
- do we want a standard volume to compare to?
- count the # of tasks for each thing, and the hourly wage on each, and total expenditure. general stats page
- read thru instructions one more time
